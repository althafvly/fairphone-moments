The Fairphone (Gen. 6) comes with a physical switch on the side which, by default, will trigger Fairphone Moments. Fairphone Moments is a brand new minimalist experience to use your Fairphone with fewer distractions. This gives you the freedom to disconnect when you want and stay fully present in real life or customize moments fitted to your own experiences, such as focus and travel modes.
